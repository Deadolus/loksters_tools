Lokster's Tools for Engraving through Inkscape
============
This is a inkscape plugin, generating Gcode files from Vector Paths in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/).
**The code originally came from [Lokster](http://lokspace.eu/anet-a8-3d-printer-laser-engraver-mod/) and I only changed to suit my needs.**
I changed the behaviour so that the calibration up front is optional.
I also changed a scaling factor, because the old one seemed to produce too small results for me.


Head over to (Lokster's Webpage)[http://lokspace.eu/anet-a8-3d-printer-laser-engraver-mod/] for a tutorial on how to use the Inkscape plugin.
